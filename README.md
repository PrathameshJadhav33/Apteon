## Summary :clipboard:

Apteon is a collection of Aptitude based Games used in the recruitment process of various companies.
We found these games to be very engaging and enjoyable at the same time. So we decided to create an Android Application based on these games to target the students and the casual gamers who want to indulge in some aptitude based games.
